# Schengen Appointment Checker

This repository is a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind app that displays appointment availability using Atlys APIs (with demo fallbacks).

## How it is deployed
A GitHub Actions workflow builds the app and publishes the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch. The site will be available under GitHub Pages once the action succeeds.

If you want a quicker deployment, consider connecting the repo to Vercel (one-click).
